Shame that you stopped at 25. That was a little too early.

3.3 4/5p
Convergence times should differ slightly over multiple runs.

3.4 4/5p
That is the advantage of chosen centroids over random. Kmeans++ could have been mentioned.

4.1 10/10p

4.2 7/10p
Your approach is good, however your comments are not detailed enough, you should use other indicator other than the likelihood (AIC, BIC). The plot in figure 13 would be better if all the curves are in one plot


4.3 7/15p
Didn’t answer the question on which galaxies are “older” and which are “younger”. Prediction of clusters not good (only 2% explained variance)
