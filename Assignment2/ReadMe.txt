Missing Values

The presentation will consist of 3 main parts:
- Types of missing data
- Single imputation
- Multiple imputation

As our data source, we used a dataset containing information about the passengers 
of the Titanic.
We will give examples of how single imputation and multiple imputation work for this
dataset, using Jupyter Notebook with Python (single imputation) and R (multiple imputation).
