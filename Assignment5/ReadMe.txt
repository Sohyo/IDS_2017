Run 'package_install.R' to install the packages we use in the scripts.

In 'config.py' set the path of the directory containing the CSV file(we assume the CSV file have the original names).

You need to install the following Python libraries: matplotlib, sickit-learn, scipy, pandas, python-tk, ggplot.
