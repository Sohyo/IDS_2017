How to run:
We used Python (version 2.7).

Run 'package_install.R' to install the packages we use in the scripts.

In 'config.py' set the path of the directory containing the CSV file(we assume the CSV file have the original names).

You need to install the following Python libraries: matplotlib, sickit-learn, scipy, pandas, python-tk, ggplot, numpy.

For exercise 2.1, run the 2_1_a.py, 2_1_b.py, 2_1_c.py.

Before running the scripts for exercise 2.2, run create_65_and_48.py to generate the training csv files.

For exercise 2.2, run 2.2a.py, 2.2b.py, 2.2bRF.py.
To generate the predictions for the unlabeled subjects, run prediction.py.
