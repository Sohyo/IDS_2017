How to run:
We used Python (version 2.7).

In 'config.py' set the path of the directory where you want to save the csv files for the term frequency (exercise 1.1).

You need to install the following Python libraries: nltk, string, numpy, csv, time, matplotlib, pylab, pandas, powerlaw, operator, sklearn, sys.

Each of the exercises has a corresponding Python script.
Script 2_3.py needs to be run with command line arguments as explained in the report.

The report is Report.pdf.
