To Thee Old Cause  To thee old cause!Thou Reader  Thou reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I, Therefore for thee the following chants.Long and long has the grass been growing, Long and long has the rain been falling, Long has the globe been rolling round.For thee come trooping up thy waters and thy lands; Behold!Dear prison'd soul bear up a space,      For soon or late the certain grace;      To set thee free and bear thee home,      The heavenly pardoner death shall come.Centuries after thou art laid in thy grave, The shore thou foundest verifies thy dream.)Thee in an education grown of thee, in teachers, studies, students,     born of thee, Thee in thy democratic fetes en-masse, thy high original festivals,     operas, lecturers, preachers, Thee in thy ultimate, (the preparations only now completed, the     edifice on sure foundations tied,) Thee in thy pinnacles, intellect, thought, thy topmost rational     joys, thy love and godlike aspiration, In thy resplendent coming literati, thy full-lung'd orators, thy     sacerdotal bards, kosmic savans, These!Nor think we forget thee maternal; Lag'd'st thou so long?
