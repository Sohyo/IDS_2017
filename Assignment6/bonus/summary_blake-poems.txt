"Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;    Sing thy songs of happy cheer:!"THE LAMB      Little Lamb, who make thee    Dost thou know who made thee,  Gave thee life, and bid thee feed  By the stream and o'er the mead;  Gave thee clothing of delight,  Softest clothing, wolly, bright;  Gave thee such a tender voice,  Making all the vales rejoice?Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,  While o'er thee doth mother weep.Sweet Joy I call thee:  Thou dost smile,  I sing the while;  Sweet joy befall thee!Or art not thou  A man like me?Thel answerd, O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley.Thy wine doth purify the golden honey; thy perfume.O little Cloud the virgin said, I charge thee to tell me Why thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away: Then we shall seek thee but not find: ah Thel is like to thee.I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf; Ah weep not little voice, thou can'st not speak, but thou can'st weep: Is this a Worm?
