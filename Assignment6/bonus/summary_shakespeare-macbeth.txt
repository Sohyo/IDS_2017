What he hath lost, Noble Macbeth hath wonne.Come, let me clutch thee: I haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.I haue done the deed: Didst thou not heare a noyse?Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox, Rosse, Lords, and Attendants.We haue lost Best halfe of our Affaire     1.It will haue blood they say: Blood will haue Blood: Stones haue beene knowne to moue, & Trees to speake: Augures, and vnderstood Relations, haue By Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth The secret'st man of Blood.Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?My former Speeches, Haue but hit your Thoughts Which can interpret farther: Onely I say Things haue bin strangely borne.Fare thee well, These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe, Hath banish'd me from Scotland.This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue dyed holily in their beds     Lad.The Spirits that know All mortall Consequences, haue pronounc'd me thus: Feare not Macbeth, no man that's borne of woman Shall ere haue power vpon thee.We haue met with Foes That strike beside vs     Sey.
