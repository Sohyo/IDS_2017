or wilt thou thyself  Abolish thy creation, and unmake  For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace   Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou   My sole complacence!Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.hadst thou alleged  To thy deserted host this cause of flight,  Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.rememberest thou  Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?Then who created thee lamenting learn,  When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.Hence then, and evil go with thee along,  Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;  Thou and thy wicked crew!Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve  First thy obedience; the other who can know,  Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,  Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.Hast thou eaten of the tree,  Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply  By thy conception; children thou shalt bring  In sorrow forth; and to thy husband's will  Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule.O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds,  Thy trophies!
